# Fuck this shit
Ok, this repo is public because I don't give a fuck about this anymore. If someone wants to take it over, feel free, but I'll keep working on it for now.

I just need to rant about how god-awful writing unsharing code is. There is a reason that it wasn't really touched for a long time. There are countless unknowns in the game's resources service that we are just casually ignoring and hoping won't fuck us over.

This shit is horrible, and I am only doing it because I feel guilty for leaving it half-baked. That's all.
